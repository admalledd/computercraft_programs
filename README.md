computercraft_swarm
===================

based upon inspiration from https://github.com/ottomated/turtle-gambit/ (thanks!)
but because I am a C# dev, use that for server-side stuffs
also the goal here is more about swarm turtle playground-stuff vs other
so there is a extra ForgeMod required that adds a "get actual position" helper for the turtles.



OLD NOTES FOLLOW:
=================

computercraft_programs
======================

computercraft programs/scripts (written in Lua), and httplib helpers (python)

use `pastebin get 1LbqbiuM getprog` to download the current version of the getprog program onto your
computer. then use the getprog program to download any of these programs.


Coding Conventions
==================

In general because I am a python programmer at heart, we follow all applicable [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) conventions. Meaning:

* 4-space tabs stops
* lower_case_under_scored functions and variables (not classes!)
* camelCase classes (not objects!)
* doc-string like comments at the start of functions/blocks of code
