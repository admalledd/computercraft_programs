Coding Conventions
==================

In general because I am a python programmer at heart, we follow all applicable [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) conventions. Meaning:

* 4-space tabs stops
* lower_case_under_scored functions and variables (not classes!)
* camelCase classes (not objects!)
* doc-string like comments at the start of functions/blocks of code
